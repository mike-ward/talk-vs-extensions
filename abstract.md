Title:

Writing Visual Studio Extensions

Abstract:

If you're a Visual Studio user, it's likely you have a favorite
extension or two like ReSharper or Web Essentials. You may even have an
idea for your own extension. But, how do you go about writing one?

In this session, I'll get you started writing extensions. We'll start
with the basics and then quickly proceed to more advanced concepts like
MEF and extension points. We'll explore how to add your own dialog pages
to Visual Studio's options page and go over the more useful extension
interfaces. I'll also explore some of the darker corners of extension
development such as Visual Studio's COM interfaces, which work in
different and unexpected ways from standard COM interfaces. By the end
of this session, you should have the confidence to begin writing your
own extension.

Writing extensions is challenging and requires advanced skills. To get
the most out of this session, you should have a solid understanding of
C\#. MEF and COM.
